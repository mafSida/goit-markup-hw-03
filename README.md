# GoIT Markup Home Work 3

Responsive layout with Flexbox and element geometry configuration.

## Overview
This project is the third assignment of the GoIT Full Stack Developer course. It builds on the previous work by introducing CSS Flexbox for layout and positioning of elements. I focused on configuring element geometry, margins, paddings, and borders. The project also includes image optimization and uses the `modern-normalize` stylesheet for consistent cross-browser styling.

The design mockup used for this assignment can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/wuEpGhwCepGCOUw7mZFRac/Web-Studio-(Version-5.0)?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=iMO7bWQ8BFWCih1e-0).

## Summary
In this project, I have:
- Applied Flexbox for layout and element positioning.
- Configured margins, paddings, and borders based on the design mockup.
- Used semantic HTML and CSS best practices.
- Optimized images using the Squoosh service.
- Added and customized modern-normalize to reset default styles.

This assignment strengthened my skills in responsive design, layout structuring with Flexbox, and using CSS for fine-tuning element geometry.
